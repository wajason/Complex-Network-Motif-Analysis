# Complex-Network-Motif-Analysis
A rigorous analysis of complex network topology using Motif frequency counting. This study compares Biological (PROTEINS), Chemical (MUTAG), and Social (IMDB) networks to derive their unique "structural fingerprints" and explores the connection between network function and high-order localized patterns.
